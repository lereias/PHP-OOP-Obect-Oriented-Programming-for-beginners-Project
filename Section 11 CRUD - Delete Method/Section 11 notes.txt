create delete method in User class in
htdocs/gallery/admin/includes/user.php

//delete a user
public function delete() {
    global $database;

    $sql = "DELETE FROM users ";
    $sql .= "WHERE id= " . $database->escape_string($this->id); 
    $sql .= " LIMIT 1";

    $database->query($sql);

    return (mysqli_affected_rows($database->connection) == 1) ? true : false;
}

to test if the method works, include this in admin_content.php
<?php
//delete user by id
$user = User::find_user_by_id(5);
$user->delete();
?>
